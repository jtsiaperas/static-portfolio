### Represent!

Represent was born out of the knowledge that most people in the US are unaware of their elected officials beyond the federal level. It uses the Open Politics API to return a carousel list of all elected officials from the President down to local councilmen.

Represent! was implemented using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JQuery and can be accessed <a href="https://teampolitics.github.io/Represent/" target=" ">here</a>.

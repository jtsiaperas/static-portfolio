publishedDate: 01-20-2022
description: My idea of fun involves drawing on a game board with crayon and creating an imaginary railway empire in a tolkeinesque fantasy world. I legitimately enjoy arithmetic. I think solving that one problem with my code that kept it from working is a rush that no roller coaster can compete with. I would rather spend 8 hours a day staring at a black screen with white text than spend 15 minutes on the phone. I will convince you to play my train game, and you will have a good time. That's who I am.

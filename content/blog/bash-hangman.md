### BASH HANGMAN


BASH HANGMAN is an experiment in interactive design inspired by the BASH terminal interface. The words are all terminal commands, and with the exception of the decorative lines at the top of the screen, all design is ASCII art. 

BASH HANGMAN was implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, and deployed on GitHub. It can be accessed <a href="https://jtsiaperas.github.io/Hangman-Game/" target=" ">here</a>.
